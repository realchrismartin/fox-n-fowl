## About the Project

Fox n' Fowl (FnF) is an isometric 3d side-scrolling game implemented using [fox-engine](https://github.com/realchrismartin/fox-engine). This project was started as an excuse to develop a game engine and software renderer using some of my learnings from working on other games and game engines.

This repository contains the game content.
